## Why "Windwaker"?
One of my all-time favorite metalcore bands that I listen to is [Windwaker](https://youtu.be/HlIb9sXTEXo), and <i>their</i> name, in turn, was inspired by The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker game. And also wind kinda correlates with the minty green aesthetic I'm looking for. That's pretty much it.
